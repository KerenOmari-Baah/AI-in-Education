# Institutional GenAI Policy Frameworks

## Introduction

The rapid integration of generative AI tools into academic life has forced universities into a state of re-evaluation. The once theoretical question  *"Should students use AI to support learning?"*  is now a daily reality on campuses worldwide. Institutions are grappling with how to address this shift: should AI be banned, strictly controlled, or embraced under clear guidelines?

From global higher education conferences to internal faculty meetings, there are two dominant schools of thought. One group advocates for restriction arguing that AI undermines critical thinking and opens the door to academic dishonesty. The other proposes adaptation, suggesting AI can be leveraged ethically to support student success, improve teaching, and prepare learners for a tech-integrated future.

This insight reflects on global trends and proposes core principles for institutions developing their own GenAI policies.

## What the Landscape Looks Like

Despite the pace of AI adoption by students, most universities still lack cohesive frameworks for guiding its use. In regions like sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, few institutions have public AI policies not due to lack of interest, but due to resource constraints and uncertainty about regulation.

In contrast, several European universities have begun experimenting with structured policies. The University of Cambridge issued an AI policy that stresses transparency and instructor discretion, while KU Leuven (Belgium) provides specific guidance on referencing AI tools in assignments. US-based institutions like Stanford and Princeton have launched task forces to assess AI's impact across teaching, ethics, and policy.

However, even among these schools, policy development is ongoing and inconsistent. Some departments encourage experimentation, while others prohibit AI altogether. For students, the result is confusion not clarity.

## Principles to Consider When Building Policy

If universities are to move forward responsibly, policy creation must be thoughtful, inclusive, and grounded in academic values. Based on literature, institutional experiments, and early feedback from students and faculty, the following principles are emerging:

### 1. Academic Integrity, Not Prohibition  
Policies should focus on *how* to use AI responsibly, not whether to use it at all. Outright bans are often ineffective and risk pushing usage underground. Instead, institutions should teach students what appropriate AI usage looks like, for instance as a writing assistance to brainstorming and revision support.

### 2. Instructor Autonomy  
Each course and discipline may require a different approach. Policies should give lecturers the flexibility to define acceptable AI use within their own classes, while also providing them institutional support and guidance.

### 3. Transparency and Openness  
Students must be encouraged to disclose AI use clearly and consistently. This builds trust and encourages thoughtful reflection about the tools theyâ€™re using. Policies should define how students cite AI outputs, such as ChatGPT, and when attribution is required.

### 4. Inclusive Design  
Policies must consider all stakeholders and not just students. Faculty, teaching assistants, admin, and tech support teams all play a role in making AI use ethical and accessible. 

Additionally, policies should ensure equity of access: not all students can afford premium AI tools. Institutions should explore licensed tools or make free resources visible and available.

### 5. Flexibility and Continuous Update  
The pace of AI development is too fast for static rules. Policies must be revisited frequently and allow for agile revisions. Open dialogue between departments and regular student feedback can help keep policies relevant and fair.

## Why This Matters

GenAI is not a passing trend. It is reshaping how knowledge is accessed, processed, and communicated. Just as the internet and calculators once forced schools to rethink learning, AI demands a similar evolution. 

By resisting or avoiding the conversation, institutions risk losing credibility and failing to prepare students for the real world. But with open eyes, collective effort, and grounded policy frameworks, AI can be integrated in ways that preserve integrity and enhance learning.

This is not about allowing shortcuts, it's about teaching students how to use powerful tools with skill, honesty, and purpose.
